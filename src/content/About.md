# Hi there!

My name is Monika Janas, and I'm a software engineer currently working at Microsoft on the Azure PlayFab team.

I'm passionate about computer graphics and full-stack web development. I have a wide range of professional experience, including Android development, game development, and in my current role, full-stack web development using React.js, .NET Framework, DynamoDB and Azure Data Explorer (Kusto).

Outside of programming, I enjoy spending time on a wide range of hobbies - baking, playing video games, reading, knitting, and practicing piano.
